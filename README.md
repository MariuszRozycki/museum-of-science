I made a website Museum of science as a study semester project. Site was designed by me and appeals to target audience.

## Description
This is as a first semester project. Project includes design principles, project management, communication technology, and developing with HTML/CSS. 
The target audience is carefully considered. A prototype of the website is made using Adobe XD. [link to prototypes](https://xd.adobe.com/view/233a9331-2653-4c76-80d0-bb6d72fadf3d-7669). <br> 
To create this website I used HTML, CSS and pure Java Script.
Compositional principles, typography and color schemes are considered.
HTML is semantic and neatly indented. 
Site uses external CSS style sheets which follow the DRY principle.
Site downloads quite quickly. Images are not over 200kb.
The site takes WCAG principles into consideration, especially regarding hierarchy, navigation and color usage.
Site is responsive, attractive and easy to use on variety of devices.
Site shows consideration for content strategy and SEO (meta tags and alt text).
