I made a website Museum of science as a study semester project.
Site was designed by me and appeals to target audience defined by school.
Compositional principles, typography and color schemes are considered.
HTML is semantic and neatly indented. 
Site uses external CSS style sheets which follow the DRY principle.
Site downloads quite quickly. Images are not over 200kb.
The site takes WCAG principles into consideration, especially regarding hierarchy, navigation and color usage.
Site is responsive, attractive and easy to use on variety of devices.
Site shows consideration for content strategy and SEO (meta tags and alt text).
